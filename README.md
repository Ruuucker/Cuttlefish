Simple tool for sending some multicast and traceroute packets to give you a clue what is the network you got into.

Uses nmap and it's scripts to send and recieve packets and fancy lib to draw the graph of the subnet.

Desined to be first thing to run on your way to pwn the network.

And LOTS thing to do, like ARP and scan snmp ports to do a remote ARP scan.
Any critic will be appreciated.
